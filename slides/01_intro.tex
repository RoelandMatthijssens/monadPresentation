    \begin{block}{Limitations}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item No state change
            \item No side effects
            \item What about IO?

    \begin{block}{Disclaimer}
        Monads are a tricky subtle subject to explain. But very simple once you understand them. To
        understand them something needs to 'click'. I'll do my best to help you make that click. But no garantees.
